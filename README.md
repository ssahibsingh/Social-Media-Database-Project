<h1 align="center">Social Media Database Project</h1>

# About❓
<ul>
<li>Through this project  we are creating a basic structure of social media database which could easily be connected to frontend interface.  </li>
<li>Here we are managing the data of multiple users, their followers  , interests and public activity on the social media platform which includes postlikes ,comments , commentlikes , hashtag followed ,bookmarks and many more... </li>
<li>Through our SQL query we have shown a clear cut description of connection and inter relation between different activities on social media. </li>
<li>Here we have  tried to fetch and store the  data in its true storage form into this database like (img/videos in url) </li>
<li>With our true efforts and research  we have tried to give a simple and more exact view of a basic social interconnecting site.</li>
</ul>
